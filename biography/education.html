    <h1>University education and training</h1>
    <p>In 1926 Fuchs went to St John's College, Cambridge. His tutor was James 
      Wordie, who had been Senior Scientist on Shackleton's Endurance Imperial 
      Trans-Antarctic Expedition between 1914 and 1916. Wordie became Fuchs's 
      influential mentor and took him to the Arctic on an expedition. Much later, Wordie was key in supporting the 
      planning of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition.</p>
    <p> Fuchs read Geology, Zoology and Botany, graduating in 1930 with a Third. 
      Always keen on sport, he played in the College Rugby XV, rowed, played tennis 
      and cricket. His parents gave him a small two-seater silver Austin 7, named <cite>Lepsima</cite> after the arthropod (commonly known as a silver fish) which led 
      to an enduring passion for fast cars. <cite>Lepsima</cite> was later followed by a Riley sportscar, two MGs, a Sunbeam Talbort and a succession of Jaguars.</p>
	  <p>'Roof climbing' was popular among 
      some of the students, including Fuchs. Staying out at night was not permitted 
      and students were required to be in College by 10pm, but it was said that 
      there were at least 14 ways of getting back inside the College without using 
      the front gate. This activity did not go unnoticed - much later, Wordie 
      sent an account to the <em>Times</em> of a summer expedition to Greenland, 
      in which he mentioned that 'the ninth member of the team gained his [mountaineering] 
      experience among the roofs and towers of Cambridge'.</p>
    <p>After exams in the summer of 1929, Fuchs was invited to join James Wordie 
      on his summer expedition to Greenland. On 2nd July the party of four geologists, 
      two surveyors, a doctor and a physicist, sailed from Aberdeen aboard the 
      <em>Heimland</em>, a 64-ton Norweigan seal-hunting ship. Six days later 
      the ship entered the pack ice and progress became slow. Stuck fast in the 
      ice, time passed with short expeditions catching seal and bear to eat, collecting 
      and identifying animals, plants and birds. After a month of slow progress 
      through the ice, they at last sighted Greenland and sailed up the Franz 
      Josef Fjord to anchor inland at Kjerulf Fjord, long behind schedule with 
      only three weeks left to complete the field work, which included climbing 
      Petermann Peak. Wordie and two others reached the summit (9650 ft) on 16 
      August in dangerous conditions.</p>
    <p>The Greenland expedition was Fuchs's first experience of polar work, and 
      was to shape his future as explorer, scientist and leader. He describes 
      this expedition as a 'memorable baptism of ice'. Following the Greenland 
      Expedition Fuchs returned to Cambridge for a fourth year to read Geology 
      and, encouraged by Wordie, to write a paper with a fellow expedition member 
      on some of their findings - his first publication.</p>
