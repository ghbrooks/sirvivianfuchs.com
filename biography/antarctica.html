    <h1>First Antarctic Years </h1>
    <p><img src="images/ANTVEF50.jpg" alt="" name="image" width="140" height="185" id="image" align="right" />In 
      1947 Fuchs learned of the Falklands Islands Dependencies Survey - whose 
      members were known as Fids - which then occupied seven bases in the Antarctic. 
      The primary purpose was to strengthen Britain's claim to sovereignty. Fuchs 
      applied for a position as Geologist, was interviewed and offered the job 
      of overall Field Commander of all the Antarctic activities, based at Stonington 
      Island on the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
    <p>Fuchs was one of 27 Fids to travel to the Antarctic in December 1947, and 
      was given the freedom to plan the scientific programme for the duration 
      of their stay. At Stonington, eleven men lived in cramped quarters and Fuchs 
      quickly became the natural, as well as the appointed, leader of the group. 
      Between 1948 and 1950 the men made a series of expeditions south from their 
      base on the Peninsula. </p>
    <p>The group had planned to have the use of an aircraft for their expeditions 
      but some vital parts had been left behind and so all travel was by dog-sledging. 
      Like the other new men Fuchs had to learn to drive a team; his lead dog 
      was 'Darkie' with whom he developed a close rapport.</p>
    <p>From October 1948 the Governor of the Falkland Islands, Sir Miles Clifford, 
      took charge of the FIDS. In April 1949 the sea ice remained fast in Marguerite 
      Bay and the relief ship <em>John Biscoe</em> could not reach Stonington, 
      so the men were stuck for a further winter - for five of them this was their 
      third consecutive winter. They became known as the 'Lost Eleven' and lasting 
      bonds were formed. Despite the failure of the relief ship to deliver new 
      supplies, Fuchs and his colleagues had a productive year, including a study 
      of emperor penguins at a newly discovered colony.</p>
    <p>In 1950 the sea ice cleared in early February and the ship was finally 
      able to get through. Stonington Base was closed and all except 36 dogs had 
      to be put down, because no more than this could be accommodated on board 
      ship. The surviving dogs were dispersed to other bases - a team of nine 
      returned to Britain and performed in the Festival of Britain, led by Darkie, 
      who later went to live with Fuchs and became a familiar sight in Cambridge. 
      Fuchs returned to the UK by sea via the Falkland Islands, the port of Santos 
      in Brazil, Lisbon (Portugal) and finally to Southampton.</p>
