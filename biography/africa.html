    <p><img src="images/AFRVEFxx.jpg" width="130" height="175" align="right" />Through 
      an acquaintance with Louis S B Leakey, research fellow at St John's College, 
      Vivian Fuchs was introduced to Dr Barton Worthington and on the recommendation 
      of his tutor, James Wordie, was recruited as geologist to the 1930 - 31 
      Cambridge <a href="../expeditions/africa/lakes.html" title="Find out more about the expedition to the East African Lakes">Expedition 
      to the East African Lakes</a>. The objective was to study the biology and 
      geology of the lakes in the Great African Rift Valley.</p>
    <p>Often working alone, Fuchs quickly grew acclimatised to the harsh conditions 
      and was just as captivated by the vast, hot continent as he had been by 
      the Arctic pack ice. After Lake Baringo in Kenya, the expedition moved on 
      to Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in northern Kenya, using vehicles and 
      camels to transport men and equipment. On return to Baringo Fuchs became 
      seriously ill with malaira, and was hospitalised in Nairobi for two months 
      before he rejoined the expedition. In western Uganda, he travelled into 
      what is now Za&iuml;re and spent a month studying Lake George.</p>
    <p>In 1931 Fuchs joined Louis Leakey on an <a href="../expeditions/africa/olduvai.html" title="Find out more about the expedition to Olduvai">archaeological 
      expedition to Olduvai</a> in Tanzania, finding stone-age tools and mammal 
      fossils which were sent to the Natural History collection at the British 
      Museum.</p>
    <p><img src="images/FMYJCFxx.jpg" alt="" name="joyce" width="120" height="164" id="joyce" align="left" />In 
      1933 Fuchs married his cousin, Joyce Connell. A world traveller in her own 
      right, Joyce accompanied Vivian on his <a href="../expeditions/africa/rudolf.html" title="Find out more about the expedition to Lake Rudolf">expedition 
      to Lake Rudolf</a> (now Lake Turkana) in 1934. Plans were submitted to the 
      Royal Society, Royal Geographical Society and other funding bodies, to raise 
      the £2000 necessary to sustain six men for a year on the expedition.</p>
    <p><img src="images/02.jpg" alt="Sir Vivian Fuchs" width="120" height="123" align="right" />In 
      Kenya, west of Lake Turkana, they collected the first pre-Neolithic implements 
      found in the lake basin, then travelled north to the frontier with Sudan. 
      Returning to Naivasha, the expedition re-fitted for the second part and 
      set out for Lake Turkana to resume geological and survey work. Here they 
      made the first recorded visit to South Island and found signs of human occupation. 
      When Fuchs returned to the mainland to continue his geological work, disaster 
      struck and his two companions were lost. After intensive 
      searches for more than eight days the search had to be called off.</p>
    <p>Although Fuchs's first expedition had ended earlier than planned in tragic 
      circumstances, the scientific work was not lost and led to his PhD.</p>
    <p>In 1935 Joyce and Vivian Fuchs bought their first home, at 72 Barton Road in Cambridge. In February 1936, their daughter Hilary was born. The following year they 
      bought the house known as Barton Cottage, 79 Barton Road and the next door plot 76 Barton Road (undeveloped). Barton Cottage was later sold and the house and garden eventually acquired by Wolfson College.</p>
    <p>After writing up his PhD at the Sedgwick Museum (now Department of Earth 
      Sciences) at the University of Cambridge, Fuchs organised an expedition 
      to investigate the <a href="../expeditions/africa/rukwa.html" title="Find out more about the expedition to Lake Rukwa">Lake 
      Rukwa basin</a> in southern Tanzania in 1937. Sadly, when he returned in 
      1938 to a new daughter, Rosalind, she was diagnosed with severe cerebral 
      palsy, with tragic consequences for the family. Rosalind died aged almost 
      eight.</p>
