    <h1><img src="images/vef.jpg" alt="Sir Vivian Fuchs" width="130" height="170" align="right" />The 
      Trans-Antarctic Expedition </h1>
    <p>During episodes of bad weather on long journeys from Stonington Island 
      in 1948 and 1949, Fuchs had begun to develop plans for an expedition to 
      cross the Antarctic from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea. This had previously 
      been attempted, unsuccessfully, by Wilhelm Filchner in 1911 and by Ernest 
      Shackleton in 1914.</p>
    <p>In April 1955 Fuchs took leave from the Bureau to plan and undertake the 
      Trans-Antarctic Expedition. There was much to do. Financial support had 
      to be secured - some £725,000 (about £10 million today). He received support 
      from his old friend and tutor at Cambridge, James Wordie, but was opposed 
      by many in the British polar / geographical establishment, some seeking 
      funds for the FIDASE.</p>
    <p>However, Sir Winston Churchill supported his plans and eventually the Treasury, 
      the governments of New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, were won over 
      and gave their support. After the UK, New Zealand contributed the most, 
      so was given the decision to select the leader of the Ross Sea Party and 
      Scott Base, and chose Sir Edmund Hillary.</p>
    <p>There were three components to the expedition: the Advance Party, who landed 
      on the Filchner Ice Shelf at the head of the Weddell Sea; the Ross Sea Support 
      Team, who laid depots from McMurdo Sound in the Ross Sea to the South Pole; 
      and the Expedition party, led by Fuchs. Field teams included men from Britain, 
      New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.</p>
    <p>The expedition ship <em>Theron</em> carrying Fuchs and the Advance Party, 
      was delayed by pack ice and so the unloading of stores could not begin until 
      the end of January 1956 - very late to be so far into the ice on a small 
      ship. In 1955 - 56 a base site at McMurdo Sound was established for the 
      New Zealand team, and Scott Base was built. The main party arrived at Shackleton 
      Base in January 1957 and at the beginning of October vehicles left to pioner 
      the unknown route to South Ice, taking 59 days negotiating huge crevasses 
      in appalling conditions.</p>
    <p>On 24th November 1957 Fuchs and a team of 19 men with Sno-Cats and dog teams 
      left Shackleton Base to begin the crossing of the Antarctic. Over challenging 
      terrain the team encountered crevasses and they conducted scientific programmes, 
      often travelling no more than 2 to 3 miles per hour, but averaging 22 miles 
      per day, arriving at the South Pole on 19th January 1958. Meanwhile the 
      Ross Sea party, led by Sir Edmund Hillary, departed Scott Base over easier 
      terrian, reaching the South Pole ahead of Fuchs on 5th January. It was late 
      in the season and conditions were difficult - Hillary urged Fuchs to break 
      his journey at the Pole and finish it the following season, but Fuchs and 
      his men continued with determination to complete the crossing as planned. 
      On 2nd March 1958, Fuchs's team arrived at Scott Base in McMurdo Sound - 
      a total journey of 99 days over 2158 miles.</p>
