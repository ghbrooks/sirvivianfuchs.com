      and the British Antarctic Survey </h1>
    <p>Fuchs returned to the Falkland Islands Dependencies Scientific Bureau in 
      London at the end of 1958. In 1962, with the introduction of the Antarctic 
      Treaty, the FIDS was renamed the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). As its 
      first Director, Fuchs built up an effective team of admisitrators and set 
      about turning the Survey into a Public Office.</p>
    <p> The Treasury proposed the closure of the BAS, so Fuchs sought support 
      from various Ministries, from the Royal Society, and from his now extensive 
      network of influential contacts. The proposal to sustain the BAS was put 
      forward for consideration by the Cabinet Office and the Survey's fate was 
      referred to the Council for Scientific Policy, which advised that the BAS 
      should continue given the scientific output already proven. The Council 
      also supported the need for a new ship for the Survey. Fortunately the Cabinet 
      agreed and the BAS was formally transferred to the National Environment
