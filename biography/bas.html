    <h1><img src="images/vef.jpg" alt="Sir Vivian Fuchs" width="130" height="170" align="right" />FIDS 
      and the British Antarctic Survey </h1>
    <p>Fuchs returned to the Falkland Islands Dependencies Scientific Bureau in 
      London at the end of 1958. In 1962, with the introduction of the Antarctic 
      Treaty, the FIDS was renamed the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). As its 
      first Director, Fuchs built up an effective team of admisitrators and set 
      about turning the Survey into a Public Office.</p>
    <p> The Treasury proposed the closure of the BAS, so Fuchs sought support 
      from various Ministries, from the Royal Society, and from his now extensive 
      network of influential contacts. The proposal to sustain the BAS was put 
      forward for consideration by the Cabinet Office and the Survey's fate was 
      referred to the Council for Scientific Policy, which advised that the BAS 
      should continue given the scientific output already proven. The Council 
      also supported the need for a new ship for the Survey. Fortunately the Cabinet 
      agreed and the BAS was formally transferred to the National Environment 
      Research Council in April 1967, with an annual budget of £1 million (today 
      about £12 million). At last a sustainable structure and continuity in the 
      scientific programmes was possible.</p>
    <p>A variety of reserach groups that included Geophysics, Biology, Medicene 
      and Zoology were established throughout the country, some with research 
      stations in Antarctica. The BAS cooperated with the Scott Polar Research 
      Institute at the University of Cambridge and in 1971 a BAS Glaciological 
      Section was established there.</p>
    <p>By 1971 the total number of men in the Antarctic was 92, including 45 scientists, 
      surveyors and meterologists. By 1973 permanent staff in the UK numbered 
      53, increased each summer by an influx of contract staff being trained for 
      Antarctic service, others writing up their research, and the additonal administrative 
      staff required. In the UK it had long been planned to amalgamate the Head 
      Office and various research groups scattered around the country, and so 
      the transfer of the BAS to Cambridge was approved. In 1972 NERC agreed a 
      site and sufficient funding, planning permission was granted a year later, 
      and the BAS complex was operational by 1976.</p>
    <p>During Fuchs's 14 years as Director, the British Antarctic Survey had undergone 
      a transformation. By the time he retired in 1973, the total number of staff 
      was around 350 and the annual budget around £1.5 million (equivalent to 
      about £8 million today).With skill and vision Fuchs had guided the BAS from 
      its political origins and emphasis on geographical exploration, to become 
      a world leader in Antarctic research. </p>
