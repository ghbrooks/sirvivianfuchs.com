    <h1>The Trans-Antarctic Expedition: Aftermath</h1>
    <p>On 17th March 1958 the ship <em>Endeavour</em> carrying the Expedition 
      party arrived in brilliant sunshine in the port at Wellington, New Zealand, 
      greeted by the <em>Magga Dan</em> carrying the Expedition's families. A 
      flight of New Zealand's Royal Air Force planes roared in the skies above 
      as the people of Wellington gave the Expedition a hero's welcome. In his 
      autobiography, Fuchs writes that &quot;[after crossing Antarctica] at speeds 
      of two to three miles an hour ... suddenly being driven with Ed Hillary 
      through ... Wellington at thirty miles an hour was one of the most frightening 
      experiences of my life!&quot;</p>
    <p>The Expedition docked at Southampton in May and travelled by train to London 
      Waterloo, where they were officially welcomed by Sir Alec Douglas Home, 
      Commonwealth Secretary. The streets were crowded as the Expedition party 
      proceeded to the Royal Geographical Society for a press conference, in a 
      procession of vehicles led by an open Phantom II Rolls Royce.</p>
    <p>Two days later a private reception was held at Buckingham Palace in which 
      Fuchs received his knighthood and every member of the expedition was presented 
      with the Polar Medal. There followed a series of formal receptions, including 
      an invitation to a reception hosted by the Prime Minister at Lancaster House 
      in London, which ended with a very lively impromptu dance.</p>
    <p>A lecture at the Royal Geographical Survey, with David Stratton, was the 
      first of what became a tour of special appearances by various of the celebrated 
      Expedition party, and it was here that Fuchs received the Society's Special 
      Gold Medal.</p>
    <p>In the months following there was endless demand for lectures and guest 
      appearances that took Sir Vivian and his wife, Joyce, to Oslo, Amsterdam, 
      Copenhagen, Paris (where they were received privately by General de Gaulle). 
      In February 1959 the Fuchs visited Washington DC, New York, Indianapolis, 
      Chicago, Toronto and Montreal, a highlight of which was a visit to the White 
      House to receive the National Geographical Society's Hubbard Medal from 
      President Eisenhower.</p>
    <p>During this time Fuchs was also able to catch up on family life. Hilary 
      was by now married, after training as a nurse, and expecting a son. In 1959 
      Peter was offered a place at St John's College, Unievrsity of Cambridge, 
      where he took a degree in Natural Sciences, majoring in Geology, and had 
      his first experience of expeditions working in Alaska for BP.</p>
    <p>Almost as soon as he returned from the Antarctic, Fuchs was under pressure 
      to publish an account of the expedition, under contract with Cassell's. 
      This he began within weeks of arriving home, and with four chapters coming 
      from Edmund Hillary in New Zealand, the book was finished in eight weeks. 
      Later translated into fourteen languages, sales of <em>The Crossing of Antarctica</em> 
      were sufficient to close the gap in the Expedition's finances, and with 
      the sale of one of the aircraft, the Expedition found itself in profit.</p>
	  <p>So it was that when the TAE office closed down, the Expedition formed the 
      Trans-Antarctic Association with the remaining funds, and this Trust now 
      makes awards on an annual basis to support individuals or organisations 
      working in the Antarctic.</p>
