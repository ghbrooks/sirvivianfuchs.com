    <h1>Childhood and family</h1>
    <p><img src="images/FMYVEF08.jpg" alt="" name="vef_18mths" width="120" height="110" id="vef_18mths" align="right" />Sir 
      Vivian Fuchs was born on 11 February 1908 at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight. 
      His father, Ernst, was German and his mother, Violet, was English. After 
      a brief period living in Wandsworth, the family moved to Staplehurst in 
      Kent, where Ernst had acquired land on which he built a house called <em>Walden</em>. 
      Here the family lived happily, until war was declared on 4th August 1914 
      and their peaceful lives were shattered.</p>
    <p>Walden was in a 'prohibited area' and had to be closed. All German residents 
      in the UK were ordered to be imprisoned, and so Ernst was taken away to 
      a camp at Newbury, along with 1,000 other men. A gathering emotional storm 
      swept the country, and anti-German feeling was rife. After some time Violet 
      learned that if she could provide a financially-supported guarantee of where 
      the family would live, Ernst might be released. The family were reunited 
      and moved to Douglas on the Isle of Man.</p>
    <p>In May 1915 Ernst was again imprisoned, this time in a camp on the Isle 
      of Man. In the spring of 1917 civilian labour on farms was in such short 
      supply that selected prisoners from the camps were permitted release to 
      work on the land. Ernst was among them, and went to work in Kent, although 
      the family were not permitted to join him. Shortly after this Violet's parents 
      died, but left no will. Violet's inheritance was sequestered by the government, 
      on the grounds that she was considered an 'enemy alien', and so for six 
      long years after the war ended and the family had been permitted to return 
      to Walden, they lived a hand-to-mouth existence. Renouncing his German 
      nationality, Ernst eventually succeeded in his application 
      for naturalization as a British citizen in 1927.</p>
    <p><img src="images/FMYVEF18.jpg" alt="" name="school_photo" width="120" height="151" id="school_photo" align="left" />In 
      1917 Vivian went to Asheton Preparatory School near Tenterden in Kent, where 
      he became Head Boy and acquired the nickname 'Bunny', which stayed with 
      him for life. He developed interests in sports and natural history, and 
      in the summer holidays enjoyed walking and rowing in Scotland.</p>
    <p>Violet began the long struggle to regain the family's seized capital, eventually 
      succeeding in 1924. But the shadow of the war was long, and on his application 
      to Tonbridge, the family were told that Vivian might only be admitted only 
      after every English boy had been accepted. After a brief and unhappy period 
      at Trent College, Vivian went to Brighton College, where he decided to pursue 
      subjects that would 'keep him outdoors', particularly geology and zoology.</p>
