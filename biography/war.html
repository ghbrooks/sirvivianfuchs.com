    <h1><img src="images/vef_1941.jpg" alt="Sir Vivian Fuchs" width="120" height="165" align="right" />The 
      War</h1>
    <p>While Fuchs was writing up his research from the <a href="../expeditions/africa/rukwa.html" title="Find out more about the expedition to Lake Rukwa">Lake 
      Rukwa expedition</a> and negotiating for a job with one of the East African 
      Geological Surveys, he joined the Territorial Army. When war was declared 
      on Germany in 1939, he became Adjutant to the Second Battalion of the Cambridgeshire 
      Regiment, later joining Brigade HQ as Transport Officer. He was given compassionate 
      leave in 1940 for the birth of his son, Peter.</p>
    <p>Given his experience and fluent Swahili, Fuchs volunteered for service 
      in East Africa, but was posted to West Africa, where Swahili was of no use. 
      In the Gold Coast the troops felt left out of the war.</p>
    <p> <img src="images/FMYJHPxx.jpg" alt="" name="image" width="140" height="140" id="image" align="left" />In 
      June 1943 Fuchs was chosen for one of the highly coveted places alloted 
      to the West African Command on the Camberley Staff course in the UK, and 
      in September arrived home for a month's leave, able to get to know his children 
      again.</p>
    <p>At the end of a condensed course of four months (reduced from a year), 
      Fuchs qualified and was posted to Second Army HQ in London to work in Civil 
      Affairs. This also gave him the opportunity to visit his father regularly, 
      and they kept in close contact during the following months. Six weeks before 
      D-Day his unit left London for Portsmouth to prepare for the invasion of 
      France.</p>
    <p>Four days after D-Day, Fuchs's group crossed the English Channel to 'Gold 
      Beach' on the French coast. Civil Affairs moved in behind the tanks to set 
      up administration, slowly moving through France then advancing rapidly through 
      Belgium and into Holland, where Fuchs stayed for several months. On crossing 
      the border into Germany Fuchs witnessed the first prisoners liberated from 
      Belsen concentration camp - hardly able to walk with their tattered clothes 
      hanging from their emaciated bodies.</p>
    <p>The unit travelled through the chaos of devastated Germany to Schleswig-Holstein, 
      where Fuchs became responsible for a Kreis (equivalent to an English county) 
      with his HQ in Pl&ouml;n. The bureaucracy was inevitably stifling and counterproductive, 
      but Fuchs made the system work, learning the language and legal procedures, 
      holding court, managing the dispersal of German refugees returning from 
      the Russian front. During this time he made many friends and learned skills 
      that were to prove useful in later life.</p>
    <p>Having volunteered to remain in Pl&ouml;n after the end of the war, by 
      October 1946 Fuchs felt ready to leave Germany, and returned home to his 
      family.</p>
