    <h1>The FIDS Scientific Bureau </h1>
    <p>London Office, Crown Agents, was responsible for supplies, equipment and 
      recruitment for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Returning to Britain 
      from the Antarctic in 1950, Vivian Fuchs was appointed Principal Scientific 
      Officer for the FIDS and set up another office in London, the FIDS Scientific 
      Bureau.</p>
    <p>Fuchs's brief was to interview scientists returning from the Antarctic, 
      organise where and how they should write up their research, and make arrangements 
      for publishing the research and distributing specimens collected. Inevitably 
      these duties grew rapidly and before long the new office was well established 
      and fulfilling many more duties than the Survey had anticipated.</p>
    <p>Fuchs worked in conjunction with the independent logistics operation based 
      in the Falkland Islands and with a UK Scientific Committee, working to political 
      and scientific objectives with a split command that made life difficult. 
      However, Fuchs persevered and in 1953 the life of the Bureau was extended 
      for a further three years and it became an integral part of the FIDS.</p>
    <p>The second half of the 1950s and into the 1960s was a peak period in British 
      Antarctic affairs. The International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957 - 58 
      brought an unprecedented number of scientists to the Antarctic, and in 1956 
      the Royal Society established a scientific station at Halley Bay. In 1955 
      - 56 the Falkland Islands Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition (FIDASE) 
      was launched, and in 1958 the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (TAE) 
      under Fuchs's leadership accomplished the first land crossing of the Antarctic.</p>
